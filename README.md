# Phantom Lyrics 🎵

A "ghost-like" desktop overlay that displays synchronized song lyrics anywhere on your screen while you play games or code. Works with YouTube Music in Firefox.

## How It Works

```
YouTube (Firefox) ──► Firefox Extension ──WebSocket──► Python App
        │                                                    │
        └── Window Title ──► Browser Monitor ──► Lyrics Fetch (LRCLib → NetEase)
                                                             │
                                                PySide6 Overlay Window ◄──
```

1. **Firefox Extension** sends the exact video timestamp and page title via WebSocket (works even with the YouTube tab in the background).
2. **Lyrics Fetcher** queries LRCLib first, then falls back to NetEase Cloud Music for tracks LRCLib doesn't have. Results are cached to disk.
3. **PySide6 Overlay** displays lyrics with a transparent, always-on-top, free-draggable window with subtitle-style outlined text.
4. **Browser Monitor** is a fallback — it polls the Firefox window title only if the extension isn't sending data (e.g. extension not loaded).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Load the Firefox Extension

1. Open Firefox.
2. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
3. Click **"Load Temporary Add-on..."**.
4. Select the file: `firefox_extension/manifest.json`.
5. The extension icon won't appear in the toolbar — that's normal. It runs silently on YouTube pages.

### 3. Run the Desktop App

```powershell
python phantom_lyrics.py
```

### 4. Play a Song

1. Open a YouTube music video in Firefox.
2. The overlay should appear — lyrics load automatically, even if the YouTube tab isn't focused.
3. Lyrics highlight in sync with the music.

### 5. Build a Standalone .exe (optional)

```powershell
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pyinstaller phantom_lyrics.spec --noconfirm
```

The executable is created in `dist/PhantomLyrics/PhantomLyrics.exe`. Run it directly — no Python install needed. The Firefox extension still needs to be loaded separately.

## System Tray

When the app is running, a tray icon appears in the Windows system tray:

- **Left-click** — toggle the overlay visibility (show/hide).
- **Right-click → Reset position** — move the overlay back to the bottom-left corner.
- **Right-click → Settings...** — open the settings dialog (font, opacity, layout, auto-hide).
- **Right-click → Quit** — exit the app.

## Settings

All settings are configurable via the tray icon → **Settings...** dialog and persisted to `~/.phantom_lyrics/config.json`:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Font family | Segoe UI | Font for lyrics (dropdown: Segoe UI, Consolas, Georgia) |
| Font size | 14 | Font size in points |
| Overlay width | 600 | Width of the overlay in pixels |
| Visible lines | 3 | How many lyric lines to show (previous/current/next) |
| Outline width | 3 | Black stroke width around each letter (subtitle style) |
| Active line opacity | 220 | Opacity of the active line (0-255) |
| Inactive line opacity | 110 | Opacity of inactive lines (0-255) |
| Auto-hide timeout | 10s | Seconds of silence before the overlay fades out |

## Sync Offset

If the synced lyrics are slightly ahead or behind the audio, you can nudge them:

1. **Hover** over the overlay — three buttons appear below the lyrics: `[−] [0] [+]`
2. **`[−]`** — nudge lyrics 0.5s earlier (for LRC that's delayed)
3. **`[+]`** — nudge lyrics 0.5s later
4. **`[0]`** — reset offset to 0
5. A `Sync: +1.0s` toast appears for 2 seconds after each press so you see the current offset.
6. The offset is **saved per-song** in the lyrics cache — next time you play the same song, the offset is restored automatically.

## Auto-hide

If no music is playing for ~10 seconds (the extension stops sending timestamps), the overlay fades out automatically. It fades back in the moment music resumes. This keeps your screen clean when you pause or close YouTube.

## Multi-Tab Support

If you have multiple YouTube tabs open, the app uses **lock-on + time-advance verification** to ensure only the tab that's actually playing drives the lyrics:

- The first tab with actively advancing playback claims the lock.
- Other tabs are ignored entirely (no flicker between songs).
- The lock releases when the active tab pauses, navigates to a new video, or closes.
- A glitchy background tab can't steal the lock — its `currentTime` isn't advancing.

## Lyrics Sources

The app queries lyrics APIs in order and uses the first hit:

1. **Disk cache** (`~/.phantom_lyrics/lyrics_cache.json`) — previously played songs load instantly, even offline. Holds up to 100 songs.
2. **[LRCLib](https://lrclib.net)** — free, open-source lyrics database (primary source).
3. **[NetEase Cloud Music](https://music.163.com)** — large database, strong for Asian music and niche tracks where LRCLib has gaps (fallback source, no API key needed).

If no source has the song, the overlay shows "No lyrics found for this song."

## How to Use While Gaming

- Set your game to **Borderless Windowed** or **Windowed Fullscreen** mode.
- The overlay sits above the game window because it's "Always on Top."
- The overlay never steals focus, so your game keeps keyboard/mouse input.
- The overlay has no title bar, no taskbar icon, and doesn't appear in Alt+Tab.

## Repositioning the Overlay

The overlay is **free-draggable** — no lock, no hotkey, no toggle.

- **Click and drag** the overlay anywhere on your screen, anytime.
- Release the mouse to drop it; the position is saved automatically.
- The position is persisted to `~/.phantom_lyrics/overlay_position.json` and restored on the next launch.

> Note: because the overlay is always grabbable, clicks *on* the overlay won't pass through to the game. The overlay is small, so just drag it out of the way if you need to click something behind it.

## UI Design

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Position | Free-draggable anywhere (saved across runs) |
| Background | 100% transparent — no box or frame |
| Text outline | Black stroke around every letter (subtitle-style, readable on any background) |
| Active line | ~86% opacity white |
| Other lines | ~43% opacity white (fades with distance) |
| Song info | ~31% opacity white (very subtle) |
| Font | Segoe UI, 14pt (configurable) |
| Click behavior | Grabbable (drag to move); never steals focus |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No overlay visible | Check that the Python app started without errors in the terminal |
| Overlay shows but no lyrics | Make sure you're on a YouTube **video** page (not homepage/search). The Firefox tab title must contain "YouTube" + "Mozilla Firefox". |
| Lyrics not syncing | Check the terminal for "Client connected" — if not, reload the Firefox extension at `about:debugging` |
| Lyrics slightly off | Hover over the overlay and use the `[−]` / `[+]` buttons to nudge sync. The offset is saved per-song. |
| Can't click things behind overlay | The overlay is always grabbable, so clicks on it don't pass through. Drag it out of the way first. |
| "No lyrics found" | The song isn't in LRCLib or NetEase. The app queries both automatically. |
| Multiple tabs cause flicker | The app locks onto the actively playing tab. Make sure only one tab is actually playing audio. |

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x** — Application logic
- **PySide6** — Transparent overlay GUI
- **pywin32** — Windows API (layered window, no-focus, window enumeration)
- **websockets** — Async WebSocket server
- **requests** — LRCLib + NetEase API client
- **Firefox WebExtension** — YouTube timestamp extraction

## Credits

- Lyrics data from [LRCLib](https://lrclib.net) — a free, open-source lyrics database.
- Fallback lyrics from [NetEase Cloud Music](https://music.163.com).
- Inspired by the desire to read lyrics without alt-tabbing during games.
